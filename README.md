Features of a good developer: humility (if there's a bug, it's probably in your code); curiosity (you *will* need to keep learning new stuff); persistence (it's not going to work first time); and taking the time to read (blog posts, questions, bug reports, documentation...)

Living in Bubble.

You probably can't change the world, but you can change someone's world

Some people are meant to be in your life .

That's the thing about forgiveness, you cant get until you ask for it .

Its a long day, i don't want u make it even longer.

You know what they say when you forget some one, first you forget the voice - but you remember their face, how they walk... but i remember your voice .

The world is filled with stupid people, and I get paid to be smart.

I am playing, my best move .

You are playing a game, that you already lost .

“If you rest, you rust.” Helen Hayes .

Well, that's not an answer - Hell, that's what you are getting .

I am the best me when I am working .

Secrets have weights, the more you keep it.. the more u add up and it becomes harder to walk .

Well, I have an ugly face and that's because of God, not because of me; and you have an ugly brain not because of god, it's because of you .

And maybe my reasons are pretty selfish, maybe they revolve around me, maybe they’re all lies I’ve told myself because I just want to feel good and believe I’m a good person, but none of that matters. Not really. What matters is that I do what I do, and I try, and I work, and I see where it takes me.

Life is cruel, and it’s tough, and it’s generally unforgiving .

You never know when it’s about to fly off the rails and go to pieces.

Mine is best summed up like this. I want to help people. I know that sounds pretty simple, but I like simple.

New is glue .

Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

Static cling is another source of tight coupling

Coding isn’t some niche skill. It really is “the new literacy.”

If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room .

Hey do you know what will happen if there is no gravity on earth? I would still fall for you .

Whatever your goal is you will never succeed unless you let go of your fears and fly .

Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most people are frightened of responsibility.

Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.

Development can be achieved but not copied .

Well, it was started as an art and then it was industrialised, so it became a job? How? If any activity is time bound, it cannot be an ART. You need freedom to be creative and clock and calendar are always against freedom so as against art. A software engineer job cannot be an art unless you work for your own passionate app.

Think A to B, not A to Z.

Writing helps me get clear, and I want to be clear

Walk until nothing looks familiar anymore and your old life is a distant memory

Perspective of Life

A startup is not a "real" business but rather "an experiment searching for a business model."

Faster Feedback - More Productive

Being alone gives you the time and space to actually figure out who you are before the world told you who you should be.

Vulnerability isn’t a mark of failure; it’s the trait of someone who’s human.

3+6 = 9 so is 4+5 :)

Look back on all the things you did today. Did you act like the person you wish to become?
If you repeated today every day for the next year, realistically, where would you end up?

You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you’ve collected a lot of empty yesterdays.

But sucking up didn’t feel right?—?I just couldn’t do it. It’s not my style. But it’s so tempting do it because people get rewarded for that.

There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self .

I live to surprise.

I have learned that you hate to wake up in time that ends with am

You are thinking, not feeling .

I guess they are both things, that are never going to happen

Most people fail to see the real me

Is there a single recipe for great speech? Of course not.  But there are some essential ingredients.

It is said that across the border lives my enemy. But when I observed, I found him similar to me.

I got a chance to know about your country. And I find it nothing different than my country. Here there is same sunrise and same sunset. My country is same as your country

Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.

Your number one mission as a speaker is to take something that matters deeply to you and to rebuild it inside the minds of your listeners.

Knowledge can't be pushed into a brain, it has to be pulled in.

Hearing a talk is completely different thing from reading an essay.  It's not just the words.  Not at all.  It's the person delivering the words. To make an impact, there has to be a human connection.  You can give the most brilliant talk with crystal clear explanations and laser sharp logic but if you don't connect with the audience it just won't land. 

Fools learn from experience. I prefer to learn from the experience of others.

Knowledge is only good if you use it.

Read as much as you possibly can — but never forget to apply what you’ve learned because that is what counts the most. You put in many hours to read books, make sure you get something out of it.

Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them

Bad developers blame customers for not using the product “correctly.” A bad developer fails to take ownership and responsibility for the entire product and bugs. They make sure everyone knows exactly who was responsible when a bug was created by someone else.

Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.

What happens is not important as how you react to what happens

 the biggest reason why people do this is that they underestimate the work and overestimate their capabilities.
